"Random Recruits" mod for The Battle for Wesnoth
==================================================

This is a simple modification for [The Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org/) for multiplayer games. When this modification is enabled, the type of a recruited unit will be chosen at random from all the unit types on the player's recruit list.

Supports any era, mainline or not, but combines particularly well with "Default Union" and/or "Ageless Union", both part of [Ageless Era][1].
